- 👋 Hi, I’m @Beno
- 👀 I’m interested in Java.Script frameworks like PuppeteerJS, NodeJS, and learning basic bot development tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and JavaScript, as well as delving into the world of computer vision and the foundational principles of Software Engineering.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate in the future on open source projects and internships.

- ⚡  Fun fact:Once, I spent a solid two hours debugging a program, only to discover I had mixed up two lines of code.
  One was deleting the object, and the other was trying to save information from that very object. No wonder I kept getting "object doesn't exist" errors!
